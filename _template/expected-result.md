# Expected result

After completing this exercise you should see:

- [ ] Criterion 1 (e.g. `git log --oneline` shows your commit)
- [ ] Criterion 2 (e.g. branch pushed and visible on GitHub)
- [ ] Criterion 3 (e.g. conflict resolved and file contains expected content)

If something looks different, re-read [START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md) and [docs/common-mistakes.md](../docs/common-mistakes.md).
