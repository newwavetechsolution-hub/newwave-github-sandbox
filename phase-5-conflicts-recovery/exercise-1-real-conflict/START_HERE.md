# START HERE — Real conflict

1. [ ] On main, add a line to `shared_config.py` (e.g. `EXTRA["key"] = "value"`), commit and push
2. [ ] Create branch `feature/my-config`, change a different part of `shared_config.py`, commit
3. [ ] Pull main, merge main into your branch — resolve conflict in `shared_config.py`
4. [ ] Keep both changes where sensible; remove conflict markers; commit and push
