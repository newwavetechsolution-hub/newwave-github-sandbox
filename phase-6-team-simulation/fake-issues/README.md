# Fake issues

Use GitHub Issues (or a list below) to drive exercises.

**How to play:** Pick an issue, create branch `fix/issue-N` or `feature/issue-N`, make the change, open PR, link PR in issue, merge and close.

---

## Sample issues (create these in GitHub or treat as list)

1. **Add a `greet` function to shared-codebase** — Implement in `shared-codebase/backend/greet.py` and add a test or demo.
2. **Fix typo in release-notes** — Correct one typo in `release-practice/release-notes.txt`.
3. **Add config key** — Add a new setting to `shared-codebase/config/settings.py` and document it.

Create branches, PRs, and close issues to practice the full flow.
