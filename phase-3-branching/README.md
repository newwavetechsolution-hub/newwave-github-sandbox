# Phase 3: Branching (Teams of 5)

Create branches, merge, and introduce merge conflicts.  
From this phase onward, exercises are **optimized for teams of 5** working together in a single team fork.

## How to run this phase with a team of 5

- Use **one shared fork** per team of 5.
- For each exercise, create **one team branch**:
  - Example: `phase-3-ex1-team-alpha`, `phase-3-ex2-team-alpha`, etc.
- Rotate roles per exercise:
  - **Driver:** types commands and edits files.
  - **Navigator:** reads `START_HERE.md` / `README.md` aloud and keeps sequence.
  - **Git Lead:** focuses on Git commands and explains what each does.
  - **Reviewer:** checks `expected-result.md` and later reviews the PR.
  - **Recorder:** notes what happened and updates the team’s progress checklist.
- When the exercise is done:
  - Open a **pull request** from the exercise branch into the team’s `main`.
  - Have the Reviewer (and optionally others) review and merge the PR.

## Exercises

| Exercise | Team-focused goal |
|----------|-------------------|
| [exercise-1-create-branch](exercise-1-create-branch/) | As a team, create and use a feature branch for your work |
| [exercise-2-merge-branch](exercise-2-merge-branch/) | As a team, merge a completed branch into `main` via PR |
| [exercise-3-conflict-intro](exercise-3-conflict-intro/) | As a team, intentionally create and resolve a conflict, then share what you learned |
