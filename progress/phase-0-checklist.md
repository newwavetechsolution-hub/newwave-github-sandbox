# Phase 0 — Checklist (Git & SSH Setup)

Use this checklist once per machine before starting the other phases.

- [ ] I have a GitHub account and can sign in
- [ ] `git --version` works on my machine
- [ ] `git config --global user.name` and `user.email` are set
- [ ] I have an SSH key file `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
- [ ] That public key is added to my GitHub account (Settings → SSH and GPG keys)
- [ ] `ssh -T git@github.com` succeeds and greets my GitHub username

If any box is not checked, go back to `phase-0-setup/START_HERE.md` and repeat the relevant step.
