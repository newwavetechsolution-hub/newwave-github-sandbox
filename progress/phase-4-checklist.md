# Phase 4 — Checklist (Team of 5)

Use this checklist for your **team of 5**. Each box should reflect that the **whole team** participated using roles (Driver, PR Author, Reviewers, Recorder).

- [ ] exercise-1: Open PR (create a team branch, use the PR template, and write a clear description as a team)
- [ ] exercise-2: Review PR (have at least two teammates review using the checklist, approving or requesting changes)
- [ ] exercise-3: PR feedback cycle (request changes, update the branch, push, and complete a second review before merge)

**Team goal:** As a team of 5, run a full PR workflow from creation to review, feedback, and merge, with multiple people participating in each step.
