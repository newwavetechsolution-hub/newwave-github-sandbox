# START HERE — PR feedback cycle

1. [ ] Open a PR (or use one from exercise-1). Have a reviewer request changes (e.g. rename a function, add a docstring)
2. [ ] On your branch, make the requested edits locally
3. [ ] Commit: `git add .` and `git commit -m "fix: address review feedback"`
4. [ ] Push: `git push origin <branch>` — the PR updates automatically
5. [ ] Request re-review; get approval and merge (or merge when allowed)

Check [expected-result.md](expected-result.md).
