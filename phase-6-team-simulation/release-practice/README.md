# Release practice

Simulate a release: tag a version and update release notes as a team.

1. Agree on version (e.g. `v0.1.0`).
2. Update `release-notes.txt` with bullet points (everyone can add a line → conflicts).
3. Commit, merge to main, then tag: `git tag v0.1.0` and `git push origin v0.1.0`.
4. On GitHub, create a Release from the tag and paste notes.
