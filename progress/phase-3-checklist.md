# Phase 3 — Checklist (Team of 5)

Use this checklist for your **team of 5**. Each box should be true for the **team branch** you used in this phase.

- [ ] exercise-1: Create branch (create a shared feature branch, edit `utils.py`, switch between branches as a team)
- [ ] exercise-2: Merge branch (open a PR from the team branch and merge into `main` after review)
- [ ] exercise-3: Conflict intro (intentionally create a conflict in `app.py`, pull `main`, resolve as a team, push and merge)

**Team goal:** As a team of 5, create and use a shared branch, merge via PR, and resolve at least one conflict together.
