# Phase 6 — Checklist (Team of 5)

Use this checklist for your **team of 5**. Each box should represent a piece of teamwork around issues, shared code, and releases.

- [ ] fake-issues: As a team, pick at least one fake issue, create a branch, fix it, open a PR, and close the issue via that PR
- [ ] shared-codebase: As a team, make coordinated changes in `backend/` and/or `config/`, review each other’s work, and merge safely
- [ ] release-practice: As a team, tag a release and update `release-notes.txt` to describe what you shipped

**Team goal:** As a team of 5, close at least one fake issue via PR and ship one mini “release” together.
