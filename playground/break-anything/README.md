# Break anything

Safe place to try risky Git operations.

- **Rebase** experiments
- **Reset** (hard/soft/mixed)
- **Cherry-pick** tests
- **Detached HEAD** and recovery

Nothing here affects `main`. Clone or copy this folder elsewhere and go wild. See [docs/common-mistakes.md](../../docs/common-mistakes.md) and [docs/git-cheatsheet.md](../../docs/git-cheatsheet.md) if you get stuck.
