# Phase 0: Git & SSH Setup

Before you start the exercises, it helps to have:

- A **GitHub account**
- Git configured with your **name and email**
- An **SSH key** set up so `git@github.com:...` works without errors

You usually do this **once per machine**.

## What you will do

- Create or sign in to a **GitHub account**
- Configure your **Git identity** (`user.name` and `user.email`)
- Generate an **SSH key** on your machine
- Add the **public key** to your GitHub account
- Test the connection with `ssh -T git@github.com`

See `START_HERE.md` in this folder for step‑by‑step commands.
