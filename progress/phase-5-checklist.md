# Phase 5 — Checklist (Team of 5)

Use this checklist for your **team of 5**. At least one teammate should lead each “disaster” scenario while others watch, question, and help recover.

- [ ] exercise-1: Real conflict (create a conflict in `shared_config.py`, then resolve it together on a team branch)
- [ ] exercise-2: Rebase practice (rebase a team branch onto `main`, resolve any conflicts, and verify the new history)
- [ ] exercise-3: Recover lost work (intentionally “lose” a commit and then use `reflog` to find and recover it as a team)

**Team goal:** As a team of 5, experience at least one “disaster” scenario from start to recovery, and document the exact commands you used.
