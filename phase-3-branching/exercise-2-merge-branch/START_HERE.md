# START HERE — Merge branch

1. [ ] Switch to main: `git checkout main`
2. [ ] Merge your feature branch: `git merge feature/your-name` (use the branch you created in exercise-1)
3. [ ] Run `git log --oneline --graph` — you should see the merge (or fast-forward)
4. [ ] Push main if you use a remote: `git push origin main`
