# Exercise 3: Conflict intro

**Phase:** 3  
**Goal:** Create a branch, edit the same line as "main," merge main into your branch, resolve the conflict, then push.

---

## What you'll do

- Create branch `feature/your-name`
- Edit line 3 in `app.py` (e.g. change `MOTTO`)
- Commit and pull latest main (or have a partner commit on main)
- Merge main into your branch — get a conflict
- Resolve conflict, commit, push branch
