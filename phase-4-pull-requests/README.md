# Phase 4: Pull requests (Teams of 5)

Open a PR, use the template, review, and go through feedback.  
This phase assumes you are working in **teams of 5** using a shared team fork.

## How to run this phase with a team of 5

- Continue using your **team fork** and team branches from Phase 3.
- For each exercise, create a **descriptive branch**:
  - Example: `phase-4-ex1-open-pr-team-alpha`, `phase-4-ex2-review-pr-team-alpha`, etc.
- Suggested roles per exercise:
  - **Driver:** authors the changes (code/docs).
  - **PR Author:** writes the PR title and description using the template.
  - **Reviewer 1:** leads the review using the checklist.
  - **Reviewer 2:** adds at least one suggestion or “request changes”.
  - **Recorder:** summarizes the outcome and updates team notes/progress.
- Every exercise should end with:
  - A PR opened from the feature branch into the team’s `main`.
  - At least one **review with comments**.
  - A final **approval and merge**.
